## Features

The following section details the features available for the framework. We are constantly innovating and extending the Framework's capabilities. Be sure to check this list and the [release notes](/Release-Notes) frequently. For a condensed list, see the Features Table at the end of this section.

###  Reporting capabilities 
- Reporting software is used to gather data across sources (inventory, sales, conversion, web traffic, social media impressions, time spent, and so on) and then organize it in a visual way for users to read and interpret. Reports can even go further beyond interpreting data into tables or graphs automatically so that information can be easily digested in a fashionable way.
- Once an automated test script runs successfully, 2 HTML reports are generated so that information can be easily read and understood by the user.

###  Data Driven
- This methodology allows data to be executed seamlessly, allowing faster execution as business data needed is independent of the rest of the application.

###  Allows Multi Environment
- Having multiple environments enables a team to work on parallel development efforts. This app needs to pass many cycles like the development phase, testing, and production before saling to the public.

###  Evidence of execution
- Video and screenshots permit the app to validate that execution was made, this is done to facilitate information and isolate critical information to the dev team.

###  Capture Screenshot
- This app has the ability to take screenshot, particularly useful for automated testing and reporting test evidence. 

### Supports Page Object Model
- Page Object Model (POM) is a programmer-friendly framework that focuses clear and clean code that facilitates changes in testing and interface implementation.

### Low complexityÂ toÂ executeÂ scriptsÂ Â 
- This app has a low difficulty to execute tests since:    
    - *Page Object Model* is supported
	- *Singletons* are used as structures to share information across screens

###  Supports calls to the APIS to get and validate information displayed in the app
- This framework has the ability to make calls to the apis in order to get information and ensure that that information is displayed properly in the SUT (System Under Test).

###  Multi-Platform
- This framework can be used in your Windows, Ubuntu or Mac PC.

###  Configuration type: Properties File
- Having a Property config file means that any changes or acclarations are easier and faster to understand for both the developer team and users.

###  Data-Driven Input Format: Properties file And TestRail.
- All the test data is stored in TestRail in order that anyone who has access to the TestRail can see and update this test data.

###  Locator types	
- Locators in Selenium are the building blocks for scripts, there are many locators and they help to identify GUI elements across the web. Things like a web element name or ID may be accessed through different and special locators.

###  JENKINS
- This app makes use of: Jenkins Pipeline, this is a tool that simplifies the development workflow, as it helps the team lead manage releases and manage the team members work output.

###  System dependencies or restrictions
Selenium, extend report,javax.mail-api, json-simple, spring-core, spring-context.

###  Supported Test Levels: Integration, System and E2E
- System testing is the type of testing to check the behavior of a complete fully integrated software product based on the software requirements specification (SRS) document. The main focus of this testing is to evaluate Business / Functional / End-user requirements.

###  Supported Types: Functional
- This app supports Functional Testing, with the purpose to test each function of the software application The purpose of Functional tests is to test each function of the software application by providing appropriate input, verifying the output against the Functional requirements. 

###  Automation Driver (Appium / Selenium)
- All of the automation frameworks used in this app are Open source
    - Appium is designed to test mobile applications. 
    - Selenium is probably the most popular open-source test automation framework for web applications

###  Integration with Test Management Tools

###  Post-license support
Updates are not available after licensing ends.

###  Post-engagement use of testware 
This framework can be used for test case maintenance and execution after the licensing ends.

###  Extensive User Documentation and community support
- User documentation is important because it provides a avenue for users to learn:
- How to use your software
- Features of your software
- Tips and tricks of your software
- How to resolve common problems with your software

This framework has comprehensive guides for installation, setup and implementation.

<a name="ImplementationGuide"></a>
## Implementation Guide

### Introduction
This section will guide you on how to implement some of the most commonly used features of this framework. 

### Assertions
An assertion is a boolean expression at a specific point in a program which will be true unless there is a bug in the program. This allows us to verify that an expected result will align with the actual outcome of a test process.

### Example
```java
Assert.isTrue(login.passed);
```

### Data-Driven
This methodology allows data to be executed seamlessly, allowing faster execution as business data needed is independent of the rest of the application.

### Example: 
we use cucumber so in the "Examples" section we can add different test data to run the same scenario.
```
  Scenario Outline: - Validate that the user can login with valid credentials

    Given The user navigates to Login screen <TestCaseId>
    When The user <user> enters his app login credentials
    When The user clicks on the login button
    Then The user should land on cinema select screen

    @13524 @SmokeTest
    Examples:
      | user                                           | TestCaseId |
      | registered_user_with_a_saved_citibanamex_card  | 13524      |
	  | registered_user_with_a_saved_citibanamex_card1 | 13524      |
```

### Reporting & Logging 
The reporting capabilities of the framework are enabled by ExtentReports and Maven Cucumber Reporting.

### ExtentReports
In this case we used extent report 2.40.2 version.

```xml
<!-- pom.xml -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.relevantcodes</groupId>
    <artifactId>extentreports</artifactId>
    <version>2.40.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Maven Cucumber Reporting
We also use Maven Cucumber Reporting 5.0.02 version.

```xml
 <plugin>
	<groupId>net.masterthought</groupId>
	<artifactId>maven-cucumber-reporting</artifactId>
	<version>5.0.0</version>
	<executions>                   
		....
	</executions>
 </plugin>
```

### Insert screenshot
To add a screenshot, simply call the following method. The screenshot will be added automatically to the reports.

### Example:

```java
TestCaseResultDTO.getTestCaseResultDTO().getEvidence().add(getScreenShotAsFile())
```
		
### Create new scenarios or test cases
you can re-use the steps that are already created in the features files to create new scenarios and put them in another feature file.

### Example of steps

```
The user clicks on the login button
```
You can also use tags to group test cases.

### Example
The following scenario has multiple tags that allow us to filter in a more specific way the test cases
```
  Then The user validates the information in My Order Summary Screen for the flow <FlowType>

  @15795 @SmokeTest @PaymentFlow @RegisteredUser @FoodOrder @SavedCitiBanamex
    Examples:
      | MovieInformation             | ConcessionsToBuy | User                                          | FlowType | TestCaseId |
      | movie_traditional_experience | concession_1     | registered_user_with_a_saved_citibanamex_card | Food     | 15795      |
```

### Extending the framework by tasks.

### Example: Publish the results of the test cases in TestRail.

1. Create a class and implement the interface IRunAfterScenario, this task will be called automatically by the framework

```java
public class PublishResultInTestRail implements IRunAfterScenario {

    @Override
    public void Execute(Scenario scenario) {       
        
        if (scenario.isFailed()) {            
		 //....
        }else{
		 //....
		}
    }
}
```

2. The framework has a task system that was built using spring-core framework, the following code will call all the tasks of the project.

```java
    @After
    public void afterScenario(Scenario scenario) {
        Map<String, IRunAfterScenario> tasks = appContext.getBeansOfType(IRunAfterScenario.class);

        for (String key : tasks.keySet()) {
            tasks.get(key).Execute(scenario);
        }
    }
```

### Sharing information across screens

The framework has some DTO classes that help to share information across screens. These DTOS implement the singleton design pattern.

### Example: 

```java
public class UserDTO {

 private static UserDTO user;

    private String name;
    private String lastName;
    private String email;
    private String password;

    private UserDTO() {
    }

    public static UserDTO getUserDTO() {
        if (user == null) {
            user = new UserDTO();
        }
        return user;
    }
	
	//Getters and Setters
}	
```

## Tech Documentation

### Introduction 
The Cucumber Mobile framework was designed to allow the integration for Android using open source libraries alongside Appium for the interface with the devices and Maven for dependencies management, also the use of Gherkin language makes the test-ware generate very easy to understand by non-technical people.

<a name="ArchitectureDiagram"></a>
## Architecture Diagram

TODO: Add architectural diagram

<a name="CodeAndNamingConventions"></a>
## Code and Naming Conventions

### Common Ground:

- 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
- Prioritize coding readability instead of code complexity.
- Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.

### File Organization:

- A file consists of sections that should be separated by blank lines and an optional comment identifying each section. 
- Files longer than 2000 lines are cumbersome and should be avoided.
- Java source files have the following ordering:    
    1. Package and Import statements; for example:
        ```
            package PackageName; 
            import java.io.File; 
            import java.net.*;
            import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
        ```
    2. Class and interface declarations.

### Indentation:

- Well executed Indentation is primordial for code legibility
- Four spaces should be used as the unit of indentation. The exact construction of the indentation(spaces vs. tabs) is unspecified. Tabs must be set exactly every 8 spaces (not 4).
- Avoid lines longer than 80 characters, since theyâ€™re not handled well by many terminals and tools.

### Comments:

- Comments should be used to give overviews of code and provide additional information that is not readily available in the code itself. 
- Comments should contain only information that is relevant to reading and understanding the program.

### Declarations

- One declaration per line is recommended since it encourages commenting. Example:
    ```
    //Recomended: 
        int level;
        int size;
    //Wrong:
    int level, getSize();
  ```
  
- Bracket should act in a new line as such:
    ```
    //Recomended:
        public Method() { 
            int int1;             // beginning of method block
            if (condition) {      
                int int2;         // beginning of "if" block
                ...
            }
        }
    //Avoid:
        public Method() {
            int int1;             // beginning of method block
            if (condition) 
            {                     
            int int2;             // beginning of "if" block
            ...
            }
        }
    ```

### White Space
- Blank lines improve readability by setting off sections of code that are logically related. 
- Two blank lines should always be used in the following circumstances:
    1. Between sections of a source file.
    2. Between class and interface definitions.
- One blank line should always be used in the following circumstances:
    1. Between methods.
    2. Between the local variables in a method and its first statement.
    3. Before a block or single-line comment.
    4. Between logical sections inside a method to improve readability.

### Naming conventions:
- Meaningful and understandable variables name helps anyone to understand the reason of using it. 
- Avoid the use of digits in variable names.
- Use plural names if it is semantically appropriate.
- One character variable names should only be used in loops or for temporary variables.

| Identifier Type  | Rule |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Classes  | PascalCase  |
| Method Name  | camelCase  |
| methodParameters (Object object)  | camelCase  |
| methodParameters (int number)  | camelCase  |
| localVariable  | camelCase  |
| fieldName  | camelCase  |
| Constant Name  | PascalCase  |
| Properties Name  | PascalCase  |
| Delegate Name  | PascalCase  |
| Enum Type Name  | camelCase  |

### Recommendations
- Aim for low Cohesion and High Coupling
- Avoid using comments if possible, we should aim to have a readable and understandable code.
- Avoid using an object to access a class (static) variable or method. Use a class name instead. For example:
     ```
        classMethod();          //OK 
        AClass.classMethod();   //Ok
  
        anObject.classMethod(); //AVOID!
     ```

- Numerical constants (literals) should not be coded directly, except for -1, 0, and 1, which can appear in a for loop as counter values.

###Java Source File Example

## Packaging Technology

# MAVEN 
Apache Maven is a software project management and build management tool for Java Frameworks. 

## Why Maven?
- Central repository to get dependencies.
- Maintaining common structure across the organization. Flexibility in Integrating with CI tools.
- Plugins for Test framework execution.
 
For Maven configuration follow the installation guide
### Standard project structure use 
Under this directory you will notice the following standard project structure. 
The src/test/java directory contains the project source code, the src/test/java directory contains the test source, and the pom.xml

```
|-- pom.xml 
-- src
    -- main
    |    -- java
    |        -- com
    |            -- mycompany
    |                 -- app
    |                     -- App.java
    -- test
    |    -- java
    |        -- com
    |            -- mycompany
    |                  -- app
    |                     -- AppTest.java
```

## The POM 
POM stands for "Project Object Model". It is an XML representation of a Maven project held in a file named pom.xml 

The POM contains all necessary information about a project, as well as configurations of plugins to be used during the build process. 
Also contains at least the following fields and they are mandatory:
- groupId: GroupId will identify your project uniquely across all projects.
- artifactId: An artifact is a file, usually a JAR, that gets deployed to a Maven repository.
- version: Changes should be versioned, and this element keeps those versions in line. The three elements given above point to a specific version of a project, letting Maven know who we are dealing with, and when in its software lifecycle we want them.
```
<xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"> 
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId> 
    <artifactId>my-project</artifactId> 
    <version>1.0</version>
</project>
```
### Dependencies 
The cornerstone of the POM is its dependency list. Most projects depend on others to build and run correctly. 
If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you have gained a lot. 
Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation, as well as on other goals that require them.

```
    <dependency> 
        <groupId>junit</groupId> 
        <artifactId>junit</artifactId> 
        <version>4.12</version> 
        <type>jar</type> 
        <scope>test</scope> 
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency> 
    ...
</dependencies>
```
Maven uses a repository that is a directory where all the project jars, library jar, plugins or any other project-specific artifacts are stored and can be used by Maven easily. To search any dependence use maven repository.
